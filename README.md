# mural1970
Mural dedicated to domesticating the computer (1970s era)

Systems selected by myself.  The background art and composition done by my daughter (signed as "Carrion" on bottom left since she goes by "Carrion Crow", and also her initials at top right "AL" Amy Lewis)

The details and rationale of this mural and discussed in full at the following blog-notes:
