# mural1970
Mural dedicated to domesticating the computer (1970s era)

This is a second revision from what my daughter and I started in December 2022.

- Swapped out TRS 80 Model 3
- Added TI-99/4
- Added CBBS to bottom row
- Added reference to EasyWriter
- Updated Tandy 1000 image

The system were selected by myself.  The background art and composition done by my daughter (signed as "Carrion" on bottom left since she goes by "Carrion Crow", and also her initials at top right "AL" Amy Lewis).  The top and bottom slightly textured gray represents silicon.

The details and rationale of this mural are discussed in full at the following blog-notes:

My daughter and I hereby release this revision under Creative Commons.   Although acknowledgement would be appreciated, it is not required.  This art would not have been possible without the designers and engineers who made these systems in the first place.  No permission is needed for re-use (partial or in full).
