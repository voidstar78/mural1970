# mural1970
Mural dedicated to domesticating the computer (1970s era)

A variety of formats are available, for screen previews up to large poster prints (at 1:1.5 ratio).

Small preview:  Mural_History_of_PersonalToHomeComputers_1200_preview.jpg

Recommended for poster size:  Mural_History_of_PersonalToHomeComputers_5100_3300_alt.png

The system were selected by myself.  The background art and composition done by my daughter (signed as "Carrion" on bottom left since she goes by "Carrion Crow", and also her initials at top right "AL" Amy Lewis)

The details and rationale of this mural are discussed in full at the following blog-notes:

My daughter and I hereby release this composition to the Public Domain.   Although acknowledgement would be appreciated, this art would not have been possible without the designers and engineers who made these systems in the first place :)  No permission is needed for re-use (partial or in full) - just like the tapetries of the old days.

Happy Holidays! Dec. 2022
